# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts, experiences, and tutorials with you all.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **Web Development**: Tips and tricks for modern web development
- **React & TypeScript**: Best practices and patterns
- **Project Highlights**: Showcasing interesting projects I've worked on
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on various topics

## Getting Started

I built this site using:
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Markdown for blog content

The blog posts are stored as markdown files in the `src/content/posts/` directory. When you add a new markdown file, it will automatically appear in the blog listing!

## Stay Tuned

I'll be adding more content soon. Make sure to check back for updates!

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to sharing more with you.
